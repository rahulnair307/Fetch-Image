# Fetch-Image

This was from my TAMID Group at The University of Maryland EDU Course final project where I got experience by developing the Fetch Image project, I gained experience with JavaScript, React Native, Axios for API requests, and using the Listly API to fetch image data.

Fetch Image is a React Native application designed to offer a streamlined solution for quickly finding images. Unlike Google Search, which can overwhelm users with too many options, Fetch Image provides a focused and efficient way to get the images you need. Users can input a keyword to search for related images, which are then fetched from the Listly API and displayed in a user-friendly interface. The app includes a loading indicator, error handling, and a modal view for full-size previews, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience. With Fetch Image, finding the right image is quick and to the point.
